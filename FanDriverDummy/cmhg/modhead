; You should give your module a sensible name which describes its purpose
; both accurately and concisely. You must register any module names you use
; if they are to be distributed.
title-string: FanDriverDummy

; The help-string is the name that is displayed to the user in *Help Modules
; and other places that a more readable name is required. You should attempt
; to make this a readable version of the title-string, and - at worst - use
; the same name as in the title-string. The tail message may be used to
; indicate a variant of the module, or a copyright string.
help-string: FanDriverDummy Module_MajorVersion_CMHG

; When the module is initialised, this routine will be entered. You should
; be very careful to initialise your module safely. If anything fails, you
; can return an error message. Finalisation code will not be called if you
; return an error.
initialisation-code: Mod_Init

; When the module is killed, this routine will be entered. If you do not
; wish to be killed then you should return an error and retain as much of
; the current state as possible. Causing an abort in this routine will leave
; a 'dead' module in the chain.
finalisation-code: Mod_Final

; Generic veneers are used to provide a simple C environment for SVC and IRQ
; modes. You should register the Entry routine as the external interface (ie
; provide it as the code address to call). The Handler routine will be
; called from this. Parameters for the veneer may be specified in brackets
; in the same form as command keywords :
;   ({<field>: <value>})
; Field names:
;   private-word: <register> Private word register
;   carry-capable:           Veneer is capable of handling returning of the
;                            carry flag
generic-veneers: Driver_Entry/Driver_Handler

; The module service entry will be called to process services. You are
; strongly recommended to include the numbers of the services you wish to
; handle.
